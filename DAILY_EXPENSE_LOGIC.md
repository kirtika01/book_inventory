# Daily Expense Logic Explanation

## üéØ **Your System Logic (As I Understand It):**

### **Monthly Expense Tracking:**

1. **Fixed Amount**: Budget allocated for the month (e.g., ‚Çπ20,000)
2. **Expenses**: Actual money spent during the month (e.g., ‚Çπ18,900)
3. **Remaining Balance**: Fixed Amount - Expenses = ‚Çπ20,000 - ‚Çπ18,900 = ‚Çπ1,100

### **Carryover Logic:**

- **Positive Balance** (‚Çπ1,100): Carries forward to next month as "Previous Month Carryover"
- **Negative Balance** (overspent): Also carries forward as negative carryover
- **New Month**: Previous Month Carryover + New Fixed Amount - New Expenses = Current Balance

## üîß **What I Fixed:**

### **1. Month Navigation:**

- ‚úÖ Added month selector dropdown
- ‚úÖ Table now shows only records for selected month
- ‚úÖ Can switch between months to see different records

### **2. Carryover Display:**

- ‚úÖ Added separate "Previous Month Carryover" card
- ‚úÖ Shows ‚Çπ1,100 from August in September
- ‚úÖ Color-coded: Green (positive), Red (negative), Gray (zero)

### **3. Company-Wide Tracking:**

- ‚úÖ Removed user filtering - all expenses are company-wide
- ‚úÖ Monthly summaries are calculated for the entire company
- ‚úÖ Database functions updated for company balance sheet

## üìä **Example Flow:**

### **August 2025:**

- Fixed Amount: ‚Çπ20,000
- Expenses: ‚Çπ18,900
- **Remaining Balance: ‚Çπ1,100**

### **September 2025:**

- Previous Month Carryover: ‚Çπ1,100 (from August)
- New Fixed Amount: ‚Çπ0 (no new allocation yet)
- New Expenses: ‚Çπ0 (no expenses yet)
- **Current Balance: ‚Çπ1,100**

### **When you add new expenses in September:**

- Previous Month Carryover: ‚Çπ1,100
- New Fixed Amount: ‚Çπ0
- New Expenses: ‚Çπ500
- **Current Balance: ‚Çπ1,100 - ‚Çπ500 = ‚Çπ600**

## üöÄ **How to Test:**

1. **Run the migration script** in Supabase SQL editor
2. **Go to Daily Expenses page**
3. **Select "Aug 2025"** from dropdown - should show August records
4. **Select "Sep 2025"** from dropdown - should show ‚Çπ1,100 carryover
5. **Add new expense in September** - balance should update correctly

## ‚ùì **Questions for You:**

1. **Is this logic correct?**

   - Fixed Amount - Expenses = Remaining Balance
   - Remaining Balance carries to next month as carryover

2. **Should carryover be automatic?**

   - Currently manual (you set it in first record of month)
   - Or should it auto-calculate from previous month?

3. **Any other calculations needed?**
   - Interest on remaining balance?
   - Different rules for different months?
